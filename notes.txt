Serverless 

1. What is serverless? AWS handles, controls servers for us. 
2. Main benefit of serverless/AWS Lambda? You don't have to worry about configuring runtime environments 
and all you need to do is just simply select the runtime environments

Scenario: Per company's requirement vpc flowlogs must always enabled. For example make sure during 
vpc flowlog deletion your automations script must recreate it. What will be your solution?
Event driven solution with AWS Lambda.

1. aws iam create-role --role-name VPCFlowLogsRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
2. aws iam put-role-policy --role-name VPCFlowLogsRole --policy-name VPCFlowLogsPolicy --policy-document file://vpc-flow-logs-iam-role.json
3. Create Lambda execution policy --> lambda_execution_policy.json --> AWS IAM console
4. Create IAM role and attach lambda_execution_policy.json to the role 
5. AWS Lambda console give Lambda function name, select Python 3.7 runtime and attach role to lambda function 

aws lambda add-permission \
--function-name enable-vpc-flowlog \
--statement-id lambda-event \
--action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' \
--principal events.amazonaws.com \
--source-arn arn:aws:events:us-east-2: 062315287263:rule/vpc-flow-logs

aws lambda add-permission --function-name arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:062315287263:function:enable-vpc-flowlog --statement-id trigger-lambda-from-eventbridge --action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' --principal events.amazonaws.com --source-arn arn:aws:events:us-east-2:062315287263:rule/vpc-flow-logs

1. What is Shift Left? Secuirty is first priority 
2. CloudTrail --> Used for auditing. It captures all API (Application Programming Interface) logs 
3. What is BOTO3 --> AWS SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python 
4. What triggers Lambda function in Event Driven Solution --> AWS EventBridge service 
5. EventBridge has 2 rule types --> 1) Rule with an event pattern and 2) Schedule (Cron Job)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/index.html --> EventBridge doc 

1. Difference between CloudTrail and CloudWatch? CloudTrail used for auditing purposes, CloudWatch for monitoring/logging
2. Send Audit logs from CloudTrail to Cloudwatch Log group --> How it's being achieved and why?
    2.1 By default CloudTrail captures all API/Audit events 
    2.2 CloudTrail Console --> Dashboard --> Create Trail --> Follow the rest of the steps 
    2.3 CloudTrail creates KMS key for encryption at rest in order to secure audit logs in S3. 
3. Configure EventBridge rules to match the eventName. 
    3.1 CloudWatch --> Events --> Rules --> Go To Amazon EventBridge --> Create Rule --> Rule with an event pattern -->
                   AWS events or EventBridge partner events --> Event pattern -> Target --> Lambda --> Function Name 


Homework for coming Thursday (deadline 11/10/2022)
1. Take vpc-flowlogs existing Lambda Python runtime code and change flow logs log destination from 
cloudwatch to s3. Check boto3 documentayion. 


Scenario: Lets say company has production ec2 instances and you need to build a solution which 
periodically takes the backup of instances. What will be your solution? Answer: Lambda 
Steps to take backup of EC2 Instaces?

    1. Lets start with Pseduo code.
    2. Snpashots of ec2 instances taken 
    3. Before start developing Lambda function code, Lambda function must have right permissions 
    4. Create policy and attach policy to IAM role 
    5. CloudWatch --> EventBridge --> Created Schedule event 
    6. Make sure increase Lambda timeout (Default is 3 seconds, maximum 15 mins)
Do you make sure you only keep last 3 snapshots? Because data written to ec2 instances every day 
For example: 30 days old snapshot won't have latest changes. 

Solution: Pruning of snapshots with lambda function.

Scenario: For long term storage S3 bucket being utilized. Raw data keep dumping to S3 bucket such flat 
json files. Json data must be persisted in Database for future utilization. From Database data it easy 
to create Dashboard and query the data. 

Bridge between S3 and DynamoDB? Answer: Lambda 

Steps: 
    1. Create DynamoDB table and call Employees, Partition key --> emp_id 
    2. Create S3 bucket to store flat file. e.i. .json extension 
    3. Set up lambda 
    4. Before Lambda create an IAM role attach CloudWatch, S3 and DynamoDB policies. 
    5. S3 --> Properties --> Event Notifications --> All object create events --> Destination --> Lambda 

Scenario: How do you make sure Database credentials like username, password and db endpoint is not 
plain text and stored in Vault.
What is Vault?  is for secrets storage. It procides encryption at rest for all secrets. 
Manage Secrets & Protect Sensitive Data

How do you rotate DB secrets? 

For this I use AWS Secrets Manager. Created RDS credentials in Secrets Manager. Used python with mysql.connector
module, AWS SDK for Python boto3 and json module to parse the secret values from Secrets Manager. 
AWS Secrets Manager has native, out of box integration with AWS RDS. 

Install mysql connector  and boto3 
1. pip3 install mysql-connector-python  (link: https://pynative.com/install-mysql-connector-python/)
2. pip3 install boto3
